There are many possible factors affecting on employees leaving a firm. 

In this analysis, I explored the reasons why employees leave a firm prematurely.

The dataset consists of following factors(column), 
<pre>
	- Satisfaction Level
	- Last evaluation
	- Number of projects
 Â 	- Average monthly hours
    	- Time spent at the company
    	- Whether they have had a work accident
    	- Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
    	- Departments (column sales)
    	- Salary
    	- Whether the employee has left
</pre>
